The forwarding takes place when the first instruction at mem stage
and the second instruction at the alu stage. The two inputs to alu 
are forwarded by the value at EX/MEM pipeline registers. 
We need forwarding because the old value of r1 is used by second 
add instruction at EX stage before the new value is writtern to r1 
by the first instructino.
