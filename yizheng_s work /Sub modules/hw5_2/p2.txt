// Write your answer to Problem 2 (b) and (c) here
If we only have one alu at the EX stage, the processor only knows whether to take the branch of  
 the 1st instruction (beqz) and where the branch target address is when the branch instruction 
 reach the MEM stage. That will take 4 clock cycles. If we wait until the branch is complete, 
 we need to stall the processor until the branch instruction completes.That is inefficient and very slow.  
 
 No. If the register used by the branch instruction is the target register written by the instructin that is
 still in the pipeline, we may need to stall and wait until the valid data is ready for the branch. Thus it may 
 not always take 1 cycle.
